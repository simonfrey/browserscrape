# BrowserScrape

Neat little tool to use your very own browser for webscraping. **Early beta**

## How to setup

1. Clone Repo
2. Open "chrome://extensions"
3. Load unpacked extension from "extension" folder of this repo
4. Copy uuid and you are good

## Disclaimers

- This is a very early beta
- Default extension runs with MY (Simons) Server. You HAVE TO TRUST ME. As I could go rouge and just let your browser open whatever url I want. Self-host the server if you want to be ultra-secure
- It only works when the extension is connected to the server. If your browser is closed, NO SCRAPY SCRAPY!
